## ðŸ“„ Abstract

Rainfall plays a crucial role in the **hydrological cycle** and exhibits significant temporal variability across land surfaces. While agriculture heavily depends on rainfall, its occurrence is often **unpredictable and erratic**, leading to adverse impacts on cropping systems and depletion of natural water resources.  

In the context of India, long-term observations over the last century reveal a **declining trend** in summer monsoon rainfall, alongside a **rising trend** during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. On a global scale, water resource availability has emerged as a major concern in the planning and development of projects such as:

- ðŸŒ± Sustainable agricultural and food production  
- ðŸ’§ Effective water resource management  
- ðŸŒŠ Erosion and flood estimation & control  

Given these challenges, **rainfall forecasting** has gained significant research relevance due to its complex nature and its importance in applications like flood prediction and pollutant concentration monitoring.  

This study utilizes **30 years of rainfall data (1990â€“2019)** to perform trend analysis using:
- **Mann-Kendall Test**
- **Senâ€™s Slope Estimator**

For prediction, a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model was applied to capture patterns and project future rainfall trends. The findings aim to assist in **disaster preparedness**, **agricultural planning**, and **sustainable water management**, enabling proactive measures based on accurate rainfall forecasting.
